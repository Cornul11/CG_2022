2020-2021 course edition:
I've added a Sphere, a Cube and a Pyramid to the view using correct parameters. I load the Sphere from a file, while I manually define every vertex for the Sphere and the Pyramid.

I have implemented the rotation and scaling functions from the view. Any change in the dials and the slider will replicate in the view.

Moreover, I have implemented the unitize() function, which might be useful for us in the future when loading models and is already useful for the sphere object.

A lot of code refactoring was executed on the whole project.

We've added a CMakeLists.txt file that can be used to import the project in CLion for development.


2021-2022 course edition:
The changes we have made to the code based on our submissions from last year were minimal, mostly C++ refactoring and main class changes of various fields.
